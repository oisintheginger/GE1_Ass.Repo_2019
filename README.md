## Repository for 2019 assignment



## Concept Proposal:


	An infinitely generating hologram terrain with star particles and a central circular music beat and frequency visualizer.

	Visually it will be a combination of these:

## Project Overview:

		'Orbit Flyer' is a concept music visualizer featuring a faux solar system of enemy planets. 
		The player can use an Xbox One Controller to fly around a limited area, avoiding enemy planets,
		and exploring the small environment. Orbiting planets will attack the player when they get too 
		close by shooting plasma balls. A central music visualizer surrounds the virtual sun, and the 
		sun and the planets respond to sound beats from the music. The player can randomly choose to play
		different music. There is a perlin noise terrain at the bottom of the play-space.

 		I also used the Game Engines 1 repo for its audio example for the beat sampling

	4. 	The Hologram shader code was created from this tutorial:
